      <p>Although birds are mammals, they actually descended from dinosaurs. it has been proven that some dinosaurs had feathers. After the extinction, the reptiles that survived flourished. The one with feathers, over millions of years, evolved into mammals to survive. They also slowly began diversifying. They developed different sizes to survive in different habitats and many sizes of beaks to eat specific foods in their habitats. Today there are over 9000 species of birds.</p>
